<h1>Why do I choose BSIT?</h1> 
<hr>
<br>
<body> <h1>I choose Information Technology because I've always been passionate about creating games.</h1>
    <p>I used to develop  games inspired by Minecraft and Roblox, and through that experience, I discovered
    how much I enjoy building virtual words and bringing ideas to life.  Pursuing IT is the next step for me to
        enhance my skills especially in programming and game development. <br> 
        <br>I'm also eager to gain deeper knowledge
            of how games are created, from design to coding, and I believe IT provides the tools and foundation to do that
                professionaly.  Beyond just game creation, I'm fascinated by the problem-solving and creativity involved
                    in software development as a whole. Learning about algorithms, data structures, and user experience design
                    excites me because they all play a vital role in making games enjoyable and engaging.<br> 
                   <br> And, 
                        IT is constantly evolving field, technologies and challenges to explore. I look forward to collaborating
                         with others who share my interests and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in digital entertainment. 
                         and one of , my goal is to contribute and to  innovative projects that inspire players and make a meaningful
                        impact in the gaming industry.
                    <br>
                <br>Iâ€™m excited to learn new skills and grow as a developer, and I hope to eventually create games that not only entertain 
                but also inspire others. Being part of projects that challenge me and push my creativity is something I look forward to. 
                My goal is to build fun, engaging experiences that bring people together and make an impact in the gaming world.
